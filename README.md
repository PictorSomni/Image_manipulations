# Image_manipulations
Automations I use for my daily job (Copy them to a folder containing images and run).
Some of them act differently depending on the py file's name :
102x152.py refers to a print size in mm. If you change de numbers it will change the output files'sizes. If you add "bb" it will add a 5mm white border to the output images. If you add "fit" it will restrain the image to fit entirely in the output size (adding white borders if needed).

Same thing with 800px which will output a 800 (or whatever) pixels wide image.

It is stuff made to help me do things quickly.
